# AlloyDB Go Connector

The _AlloyDB Go Connector_ is an AlloyDB connector designed for use with the Go
language. Using an AlloyDB connector provides the following benefits:

* **IAM Authorization:** uses IAM permissions to control who/what can connect to
  your AlloyDB instances

* **Improved Security:** uses robust, updated TLS 1.3 encryption and identity
  verification between the client connector and the server-side proxy,
  independent of the database protocol.

* **Convenience:** removes the requirement to use and distribute SSL
  certificates, as well as manage firewalls or source/destination IP addresses.
